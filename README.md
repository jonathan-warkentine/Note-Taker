  ## Description:

  This app allows the user to input a team of managers, engineers, and/or students via a series of command prompts. After the prompts, an HTML page is generated for the user, with the inputted teammates' info displayed on cards on the homepage.

  To run the tests, install jest (`npm i jest`) and run the command `npm test` in the parent directory.

  ## Usage:
  

  This app offers a simple and intuitive note taking experience. Users can create a new note by selecting the "+" icon in the top right of the page, delete old notes but selecting the trash bin icon next to the note's title. The user can select an old note and see what it contains. A new note will not save unless it has a title and a body.
